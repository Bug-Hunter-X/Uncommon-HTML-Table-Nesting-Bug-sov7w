<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug related to incorrect nesting of elements within a table.  The problem stems from placing a <code><div></code> element inside a <code><td></code> cell that also contains other elements.</p><pre><code><table><tr><td><div>This is a div inside a table cell.</div><p>This is a paragraph.</p></td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Browsers will attempt to render this, but the result might be unexpected or inconsistent across browsers.  It violates the semantic structure of HTML tables and often leads to layout issues (incorrect spacing, unexpected wrapping etc.).</p>
